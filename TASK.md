## Mission

Develop a React frontend for an SPL-token escrow program on Solana Devnet.

## Who can participate

This bounty is exclusively for Solana Startup Terminal students – Dev Track.

## What to do

To participate, you must be an active student of the Solana Startup Terminal course.

### Step 1 — Mandatory: Attend the Live Lecture

⚠️ Thursday, March 26th, 19:00 (Kyiv time) via Google Meet.

### Step 2 — Complete the following Technical Task

## Scope Detail

This bounty is a practical task to enhance your Solana development skills. You'll be building a functional React frontend for a deployed SPL-token escrow program on Solana Devnet.

- Network: Solana Devnet
- Program Address: `4g5EN9Sk7wEcZqfjdjDtvq7T9u5YUrBKTe23fVJoL8yy`
- IDL: `gist.github.com`

## What to Build

A minimal yet fully functional escrow interface that allows users to:

- Make Offer: Lock Token A in a vault and specify the desired amount of Token B in return.
- Take Offer: View open offers and accept one, completing the swap.

Both `make_offer` and `take_offer` instructions must operate fully via real Devnet transactions.

## Technical Requirements

- Bundler: Vite + React + TypeScript
- Solana Client: `@solana/kit` (Anza kit) – no `@solana/web3.js`
- Styling: Tailwind CSS + shadcn-style components (recommended)

## Feature Checklist

### Wallet Connection

- Custom wallet connection modal – no third-party UI libraries.
- The modal should display all automatically detected wallet connectors (Phantom, Backpack, Solflare, etc.).
- Show wallet icon, name, and abbreviated connected address after connection.
- Disconnect button.

### Make Offer

- Input for selecting Token A from the connected wallet's token accounts.
- Input for the amount of Token A to offer.
- Input for selecting Token B (by mint address) and the desired amount.
- When submitting: construct and send the `make_offer` instruction via `@solana/kit`.

### Take Offer

- Fetch and display all open Offer accounts created through your frontend. ⭐ (Starred task for extra credit)
- Each offer card should show: maker address, Token A mint, Token B mint, offered amount, and required amount.
- "Take" button: construct and send the `take_offer` instruction.
- Display a transaction signature with a link to Solana Explorer after successful execution.

### Overall UX

- Loading states during all asynchronous operations.
- Error messages for: user rejection, insufficient balance, stale blockhash.
- All transaction links should open to `https://explorer.solana.com/tx/[sig]?cluster=devnet`.

## Submission Requirements

To participate, you must be an active student of the Solana Startup Terminal course.

### Step 1 — Mandatory: Attend the Live Lecture

Thursday, March 26th, 19:00 (Kyiv time) via Google Meet.

Attendance is mandatory. Submissions without lecture participation will not be considered.

You must provide the email address used for the live lecture in your submission.

### Step 2 — Complete the Technical Task

Upon submission, provide the following in the application form:

- Lecture Email: The email address you used to register for the live lecture on March 26th.
- Public GitHub Repository: Include your code with a `README.md` file. The `README.md` should contain setup instructions and a note on which wallets were tested.
- Live Deployment Link: A public URL (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, or similar). It must be functional without local setup.
- At least one successful Devnet transaction: Include a link to the Solana Explorer for either a `make_offer` or `take_offer` transaction in your `README.md`.

### Step 3 – Write a tweet on X

Write a tweet on X about your submission or Solana Startup Terminal participation and tag [@SuperteamUKR](https://x.com/SuperteamUKR).

## Judging Criteria

- Transactions work on Devnet (make + take): 35%
- Custom wallet modal (no third-party UI): 15%
- Available live deployment: 15%
- Code quality and TypeScript correctness: 15%
- UI/UX (clarity, error handling, loading states): 20%

Applications using `@solana/web3.js` instead of `@solana/kit` or a third-party wallet modal will not be accepted.
